In this repository I work with data acquisition and control in PC-based systems and embedded systems, for use in instrumentation and control. Some technologoies used: inertial sensors, acquisition of data from these sensors, processing of sensor data, and sensor application in systems with feedback, Arduino and LabeView. Opening the .vi-files requires LabView. The Arduino uses the following libraries:
- Arduino_BMI270_BMM150
- Arduino_LSM9DS1
- ArduinoBLE
- Streaming
For the projects Arduino Rev2 was used.
